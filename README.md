Simple Battleship game as an intro to python/coding

I'm building this as a short tutorial for kids to introduce programming concepts, such as

* Basic console I/O
* Data types
  * Strings
  * Integers
  * Dictionaries
  * Arrays
* Flow control
  * `for` loops
  * `if` statements
  * REP Loops (eventually...)
  * functions (eventually...)

Take a look at the commit history to see how it has evolved.
